# GDC-Assessment-Program
This repository is meant to be a showcase of a file parser program I created for a hiring assessment with the GDC. The programs function is to allow the user to type in a .csv file name of their current directory If the file they type in exists, the program will parse that file for the email addresses within it and determine whether or not each address constitutes as valid. The valid and invalid emails will be split into two separate lists and presented to the user.
